In this mod, you'll find yourself on top of a single lihzahrd brick in a completely empty world. Every 5 seconds you get a completely random item, with a 1/5 chance of it being a block to stand on.
Some bosses might be easy when you get all the good weapons at the beginning, but how far will you get?
